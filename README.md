# Hash Functions

The first collision for full SHA-1 was found in 2017 by Marc Stevens, Elie Bursztein, Pierre Karpman, Ange Albertini and Yarik Markov.
See their paper https://shattered.io/static/shattered.pdf

We extracted the colliding message blocks from the paper and provide simple Python code showing the collision.
